This directory is where you are to put your _Research Reports_.
There are times where research is required before progress is made. If you wish to
claim credit for time spent researching a topic for time (e.g. doing tutorials,
watching videos, reading documentation etc.) **greater than 0.5 hours**, you must
create a research report.
Research reports should be saved in `/RESEARCH` in your repository and should
include an explanation of why you needed to research, what sources you used
(including links to webpages, tutorials, etc.), how long you spent, and a summary
of what you learned. The report should be detailed enough that if someone else on
your team wanted to learn about the topic the report would dramatically cut down
the amount of time they would have to spend.
If you follow an online tutorial and produce code while following along, create a
new repository in your team's Group and push your code there. Name the repository
with the prefix `RESEARCH-` and link to that repository in your report.
You can report time spent writing the report as administrative time.
**There is a template available on Canvas as well as a simple example.**
