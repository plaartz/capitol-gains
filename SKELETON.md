# Walking Skeleton - Congressional Investment Tracker

## Overview
This walking skeleton is a basic, functional outline of the Congressional Investment Tracker application. It allows users to view the stocks owned by politicians and provides minimal filtering and saving capabilities. This version does not include real-time market data integration, but it simulates the functionality using test data.

## Some key features implemented in this skeleton include:
- The users' ability to view a list of the stocks owned by a politician (either real or arbitrary test data).
- Lists for politicians along with a method for users to filter the data (e.g. by politican).
- The ability to save filtered lists to view again later.
